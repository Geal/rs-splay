# Splay Trees

This is an implementation of splay trees written in rust. This was mostly a
proof of concept work, and it ended up working out well!

This isn't exactly meant to be used as a package right now, especially because
`rustpkg` is undergoing a lot of changes. Until then, it's just a fun
implementation.

This code is all released under the MIT license. The implementation of splaying
is largely based on https://github.com/cpdomina/SplaySplayMap
